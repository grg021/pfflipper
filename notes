To do:
- split flap display
- polish character looping when switching to other pages
- polish controls (back, stop, play, forward) and paging
- css

Tentative solution to split-flap display:
Build out an html strip dynamically with JavaScript, using stacked divs or span.
Then animate the position on, with a mask set to overflow:hidden.

Disadvantage:
Not using a filmstrip would make it even more complicated and intensive.
The number and frequency of animations required is very heavy on CPU.

Concerns:
- box dimension
- number of rows and cols? adjustable?
- transition time ok?

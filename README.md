Split Flap Simulator
===
This Pageforest.com application allows users to create an animated
[Split Flap Display](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display).  Users can enter
a series of multi-line display messages (separated by '---' lines).  The resulting simulation
can be played on an automatic loop, or advanced manually (for use in a presentation format).

To see this in action, visit [flipper.pageforest.com](http://flipper.pageforest.com).
